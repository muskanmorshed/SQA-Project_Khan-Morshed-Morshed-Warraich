# Banking System 

## Overview 

The Banking System is a console-based application that supports core banking operations. It consists of a Front End for processing transactions and a Back End batch processor. The current implementation includes a complete requirements-based test suite and an initial rapid prototype of the Front End. This system operates entirely through command-line menus and fixed-format text files.
